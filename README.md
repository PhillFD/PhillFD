🤙 Ni Hao, I’m @PhillFD

📚 I'm a third year student at the Univeristy of Auckland, studying a Bachelor of Engineering (Honours), specialising in Engineering Science

👀 At the moment, I’m interested in building scalable data pipelines via the ETL process, and Machine Learning; in particular, Neural Networks and Recommender Systems

👨🏼‍💻 I’m currently working on my own side project, stay tuned...
